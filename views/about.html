    I am a front-end developer and recent graduate of Grand Circus Bootcamp. After spending 10 years in the Private Club and Food & Beverage Industry, I have decided to pursue my passion for development. I am currently looking for my first professional experience in a development role and I look forward to designing the beautiful web applications of the future.
